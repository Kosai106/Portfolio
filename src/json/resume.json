    "summary": "Kevin hails from the vikings in the north. He never really cared for institutional education but rather focused on self learning through books and online materials. Prior to getting his eyes opened up for web development, he was interested in 3D technology and it remains a hobby to this day. He’s got unique problem solving skills and can turn coffee into code faster than you can say \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk\" target=\"_blank\">Kamelåså</a>\"!<br /><br />One of his biggest weaknesses however is his curious nature and interest in learning new technologies. This on the other hand, leads to far too many unfinished side-projects.",
